# Nutrition Intake and Bacteria Relationship

## Description
Program that will analyze nutrition intake of donor and bacteria collected from donor to observe relationship between the nutrition intake of a human and the abundance of bacteria types.

## Methods
Signal processing techniques will be used to observe the relationship between nutrition intake and bacteria abundance of donors. These techniques include:
* FFT analysis to determine the periodicity os signals of different bacteria in donors
* Correlation (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) to reveal the relationship between nutrition intake and bacteria abundance
* Clustering methods to discover similarities among bacteria to observe what types of bacteria are abundant over different periods of time
